[Py] This program was created for university work, carried out in a group of 5 members. First, I created a 'standard encryption' python code (using ORD and CHR functions), so we could all edit this code to enhance it. After that, we created a key system makes it difficult to "break encryption".

[C#] One member simplified the code and created a simple but very practical graphical user interface (https://github.com/luiz-diniz/XorCrypt)
